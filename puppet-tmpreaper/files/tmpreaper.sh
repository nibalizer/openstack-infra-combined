# Remove `/tmp/...' files not accessed in X time (configured in
# /etc/tmpreaper.conf, default 7 days), protecting the .X, .ICE, .iroha and
# .ki2 files; but removing symlinks. For directories not the access time, but
# the modification time is used (--mtime-dir), as reading a directory to check
# the contents will update the access time!
#
# In the default, /tmp/. is used, not the plain /tmp you might expect, as this
# accomodates the situation where /tmp is a symlink to some other place.
#
# Note that the sockets are safe even without the `--protect', unless `--all'
# is given, and the `.X*-lock' files would be safe also, as long as they have
# no write permissions, so this particular protect is mainly illustrative, and
# redundant.  For best results, don't try to get fancy with the moustache
# expansions.  KISS.  Always --test your protect patterns.
#
# Immutable files (such as ext3fs' .journal) are not (cannot be) removed;
# when such a file is encountered when trying to remove it, no error is given
# unless you use the --verbose option in which case a message is given.
#
# In case you're wondering: .iroha is for cannaserver and .ki2 is for kinput2
# (japanese software, lock files).
# journal.dat is for (older) ext3 filesystems
# quota.user, quota.group is for (duh) quotas.
