# This Apache 2 virtual host config shows how to use Puppet as a Rack
# application via Passenger. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/passenger.html for more information.

# You can also use the included config.ru file to run Puppet with other Rack
# servers instead of Passenger.

# This file is basically the one shipped by puppet with changes annotated
# below.

# you probably want to tune these settings
