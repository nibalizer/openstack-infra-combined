############

Stackalytics is a service that collects and processes development activity
data such as commits, lines of code changed, code reviews and blueprints then
makes it possible to visualize it in a convenient web dashboard. The
Stackalytics dashboard makes it possible to view data by project, company,
contributor, and other factors.

The primary data sources for Stackalytics are the OpenStack Git repositories
and the Gerrit review history.
