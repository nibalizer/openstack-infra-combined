OpenAFS
#######

The Andrew Filesystem (or AFS) is a global distributed filesystem.
With a single mountpoint, clients can access any site on the Internet
which is running AFS as if it were a local filesystem.

OpenAFS is an open source implementation of the AFS services and
utilities.

A collection of AFS servers and volumes that are collectively
administered within a site is called a ``cell``.  The OpenStack
project runs the ``openstack.org`` AFS cell, accessible at
``/afs/openstack.org/``.

OpenStack Cell
--------------

AFS may be one of the most thoroughly documented systems in the world.
There is plenty of very good information about how AFS works and the
commands to use it.  This document will only cover the mininmum needed
to understand our deployment of it.

OpenStack runs an AFS cell called ``openstack.org``.  There are three
important services provided by a cell: the volume location database
(VLDB), the protection database (PTS), and the file server (FS).  The
volume location service answers queries from clients about which
fileservers should be contacted to access particular volumes, while
the protection service provides information about users and groups.

Our implementation follows the common recommendation to colocate the
VLDB and PTS servers, and so they both run on our afsdb* servers.
These servers all have the same information and communicate with each
other to keep in sync and automatically provide high-availability
service.  For that reason, one of our DB servers is in the DFW region,
and the other in ORD.

Fileservers contain volumes, each of which is a portion of the file
space provided by that cell.  A volume appears as at least one
directory, but may contain directories within the volume.  Volumes are
mounted within other volumes to construct the filesystem hierarchy of
the cell.

OpenStack has one fileserver in DFW and one in ORD.  They do not
automatically contain copies of the same data.  A read-write volume in
AFS can only exist on exactly one fileserver, and if that fileserver
is out of service, the volumes it serves are not available.  However,
volumes may have read-write copies which are stored on other
fileservers.  If a client requests a read-only volume, as long as one
site with a read-only volume is online, it will be available.

Client Configuration
--------------------

To use OpenAFS on a Debian or Ubuntu machine::

  sudo apt-get install openafs-client openafs-krb5 krb5-user

Debconf will ask you for a default realm, cell and cache size.
Answer::

  Default Kerberos version 5 realm: OPENSTACK.ORG
  AFS cell this workstation belongs to: openstack.org
  Size of AFS cache in kB: 500000

The default cache size in debconf is 50000 (50MB) which is not very
large.  We recommend setting it to 500000 (500MB -- add a zero to the
default debconf value), or whatever is appropriate for your system.

The OpenAFS client is not started by default, so you will need to
run::

  sudo service openafs-client start

When it's done, you should be able to ``cd /afs/openstack.org``.

Most of what is in our AFS cell does not require authentication.
However, if you have a principal in kerberos, you can get an
authentication token for use with AFS with::

  kinit
  aklog

Administration
--------------

The following information is relevant to AFS administrators.

All of these commands have excellent manpages which can be accessed
with commands like ``man vos`` or ``man vos create``.  They also
provide short help messages when run like ``vos -help`` or ``vos
create -help``.

For all administrative commands, you may either run them from any AFS
client machine while authenticated as an AFS admin, or locally without
authentication on an AFS server machine by appending the `-localauth`
flag to the end of the command.

Adding a User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, add a kerberos principal as described in :ref:`addprinc`.  Have the
username and UID from puppet ready.

Then add the user to the protection database with::

  pts createuser $USERNAME -id UID

Admin UIDs start at 1 and increment.  If you are adding a new admin
user, you must run ``pts listentries``, find the highest UID for an
admin user, increment it by one and use that as the UID.  The username
for an admin user should be in the form ``username.admin``.

.. note::
  Any '/' characters in a kerberos principal become '.' characters in
  AFS.

Adding a Superuser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run the following commands to add an existing principal to AFS as a
superuser::

  bos adduser -server afsdb01.openstack.org -user $USERNAME.admin
  bos adduser -server afsdb02.openstack.org -user $USERNAME.admin
  bos adduser -server afs01.dfw.openstack.org -user $USERNAME.admin
  bos adduser -server afs01.ord.openstack.org -user $USERNAME.admin
  pts adduser -user $USERNAME.admin -group system:administrators

Creating a Volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select a fileserver for the read-write copy of the volume according to
which region you wish to locate it after ensuring it has sufficient
free space.  Then run::

  vos create $FILESERVER a $VOLUMENAME

The `a` in the preceding command tells it to place the volume on
partition `vicepa`.  Our fileservers only have one partition and therefore
this is a constant.

Be sure to mount the volume in AFS with::

  fs mkmount /afs/openstack.org/path/to/mountpoint $VOLUMENAME

You may want to create read-only sites for the volume with ``vos
addsite`` and then ``vos release``.

You should set the volume quota with ``fs setquota``.

Adding a Fileserver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Put the machine's public IP on a single line in
/var/lib/openafs/local/NetInfo (TODO: puppet this).

Copy ``/etc/openafs/server/KeyFile`` from an existing fileserver.

Create an LVM volume named ``vicepa`` from cinder volumes.  See
:ref:`cinder` for details on volume management.  Then run::

  mkdir /vicepa
  echo "/dev/main/vicepa  /vicepa ext4  errors=remount-ro,barrier=0  0  2" >>/etc/fstab
  mount -a

Finally, create the fileserver with::

  bos create NEWSERVER dafs dafs \
    -cmd "/usr/lib/openafs/dafileserver -p 23 -busyat 600 -rxpck 400 -s 1200 -l  1200 -cb 65535 -b 240 -vc 1200" \
    -cmd /usr/lib/openafs/davolserver \
    -cmd /usr/lib/openafs/salvageserver \
    -cmd /usr/lib/openafs/dasalvager
