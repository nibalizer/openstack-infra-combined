Puppet Master
#############

The puppetmaster server is named puppetmaster for historical reasons - it
no longer runs a puppetmaster process. There is a centralized 'hiera'
database that contains secure information such as passwords. The puppetmaster
server contains all of the ansible playbooks to run puppet apply
as well as the scripts to create new servers.

Puppet Driving Ansible Driving Puppet
-------------------------------------

In OpenStack Infra, there are ansible playbooks that drive the running of
``puppet apply`` on all of the hosts in the inventory. That process first
copies appropriate ``hiera`` data files to each host, and when it is done
it copies back the JSON report of the puppet run and submits it to
``puppetdb``.

The cron jobs, current configuration files and more can be done with ``puppet
apply`` but first some bootstrapping needs to be done.

You want to install these from puppetlabs' apt repo. There is a script,
`:file:`install_puppet.sh` in the root of the system-config repository that
will setup and install the puppet client. After that you must install the
ansible playbooks and hiera config (used to maintain secrets).

Ansible and Puppet 3 is known to run on Precise, Trusty, Centos 6 and Centos 7.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo su -
   git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/system-config /opt/system-config/production
   bash /opt/system-config/production/install_puppet.sh
   bash /opt/system-config/production/install_modules.sh
   echo $REAL_HOSTNAME > /etc/hostname
   service hostname restart
   puppet apply --modulepath='/opt/system-config/production/modules:/etc/puppet/modules' -e 'include openstack_project::puppetmaster'

Hiera uses a systemwide configuration file in ``/etc/puppet/hiera.yaml``
and this setup supports multiple configurations. The two sets of environments
that OpenStack Infrastructure uses are ``production`` and ``development``.
``production`` is the default and the environment used when nothing else is
specified.

The hiera configuration is placed by puppet apply into common.yaml in
``/etc/puppet/hieradata/production`` and ``/etc/puppet/hieradata/development``.
The values are simple key-value pairs in yaml format. The keys needed are the
keys referenced in your ``site.pp``, their values are typically obvious
(strings, lists of strings). ``/etc/puppet/hieradata/`` and below should be
owned by ``puppet:puppet`` and have mode ``0711``.

Below the ``hieradata`` directory, there should be a ``common.yaml`` file where
settings that should be available to all servers in the infrastructure go,
and then two directories full of files. The first is ``fqdn`` which should
contain a yaml file for every server in the infrastructure named
``${fqdn_of_server}.yaml``. That file has secrets that are only for that
server. Additionally, some servers can have a ``$group`` defined in
``manifests/site.pp``. There can be a correspondingly named yaml file in the
``group`` directory that contains secrets to be made available to each
server in the group.

All of the actual yaml files should have mode 0600 and be owned by root.

Adding a node
-------------

For adding a new node to your puppet master, you can either use the
``/opt/system-config/production/launch/launch-node.py`` script
(see :file:`launch/README` for full details) or bootstrap puppet manually.

For manual bootstrap, you need to run on the new server connecting
(for example, review.openstack.org) to the puppet master:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo su -
   wget https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/system-config/plain/install_puppet.sh
   bash -x install_puppet.sh

Running Puppet on Nodes
-----------------------

In OpenStack's Infrastructure, puppet runs are triggered from a cronjob
running on the puppetmaster which in turn runs a single run of puppet apply on
each host we know about.

The entry point for this process is ``/opt/system-config/production/run_all.sh``

There are a few sets of nodes which have their own playbooks so that they
are run in sequence before the rest of the nodes are run in parallel.
At the moment, this allows creation of git repos on the git slaves before
creation of the master repos on the gerrit server.

If an admin needs to run puppet by hand, it's a simple matter of either
logging in to the server in question and running
`puppet apply /opt/system-config/production/manifests/site.pp` or, on the
puppetmaster, running
`ansible-playbook --limit='$HOST;localhost' /opt/system-config/production/playbooks/remote_puppet_all.yaml`
as root, where `$HOST` is the host you want to run puppet on. If you are
working with git, gerrit or afs servers, you'll want to replace
`remote_puppet_all.yaml` with the appropriate specific playbook.
The `;localhost` is important as some of the plays depend on performing a task
on the localhost before continuing to the host in question, and without it in
the limit section, the tasks for the host will have undefined values.

Testing new puppet code can be done via `puppet apply --noop` or by
constructing a VM with a puppet install in it and just running `puppet apply`
on the code in question. This should actually make it fairly easy to test
how production works in a more self-contained manner.


Disabling Puppet on Nodes
-------------------------

In the case of needing to disable the running of puppet on a node, it's a
simple matter of adding an entry to the ansible inventory "disabled" group.
See the :ref:`disable-enable-puppet` section for more details.

Important Notes
---------------

#. Make sure the site manifest **does not** include the puppet cron job, this
   conflicts with puppet master and can cause issues.  The initial puppet run
   that create users should be done using the puppet apply configuration above.
