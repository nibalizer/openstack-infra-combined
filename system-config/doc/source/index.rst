OpenStack Project Infrastructure
================================

This documentation covers the installation and maintenance of the
project infrastructure used by OpenStack.  It may be of interest to
people who may want to help develop this infrastructure or integrate
their tools into it.  Some instructions may be useful to other
projects that want to set up similar infrastructure systems for their
developers.

OpenStack developers or users do not need to read this documentation.
Instead, see http://wiki.openstack.org/ to learn how contribute to or
use OpenStack.
